The legendary Titanic Kaggle ML competition : https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
The goal is to predict the survivors of the Titanic based on different features (name, socio-economic status...). 
My model (an arithmetic mean between a logistic regression, a naive bayes classifier, a random forest and boosted forest) has a ~80% success rate on test set 
(76.5% on test set given by Kaggle).
